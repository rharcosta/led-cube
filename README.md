# led-cube

LED cube controlled by an Arduino.

For assembly, it was necessary to use the following list of materials and 16 LEDs were distributed in 4 levels, with each level presenting a different color, in order to give the shape we know of a cube (height 4, width 4 and length 4 ). In the column are all the cathodes (negative) and in the rows all the anodes (positive).

## ðŸ“ƒ List of Materials

* 1 Arduino UNO with USB cable;
* 1 Protoboard;
* 4 BC548 or BC337 transistors;
* 4 10K- Â¼ W resistors (brown, black, orange, gold);
* 16 220- Â¼ W resistors (red, red, brown, gold);
* 64 LEDs separated by color;
* Large quantity of wires.
